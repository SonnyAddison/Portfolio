                <h2>Hello, My name is Sonny Max Addison</h2>
                <h3>Everyone has a story, here is my story</h3>
                <p>My journey began not with school, nor with wanting to code, no it starts with wanting to be a great brother.  Once upon a time, my younger sister had a wonderful idea to join the United States Army. This was a wonderful choice and I supported her all the way.  Then one day, while waiting to be shipped off to basic training (also known as bootcamp), my sister walks up to me and says “Join with me so I can get promoted before I even go to bootcamp?”
                    Who can say no to their sister? Into the recruiter’s office I went, signed up, and four years after that I saw my sister hang up her dog tags. It was not until 16 years later I would do the same realizing that no matter how long someone stays in the military, there is always an expiration date!
